# Future Plans

# V3.1
- Fixed bug where scrollbars would make code look weird.
- Fixed bug where pasting would count newlines as 2 characters in the length, which moved the cursor.
- Fixed bug where if you had selected multiple lines when inserting text, it wouldn't refresh the other lines.
- Fixed bug where cutting wouldn't refresh the code.
